## Practical Application Assignment 1

The objective of this project is to evaluate the provided data and generate insights regarding customers who accepted coupons compared to those who declined.

## Summary

- Bar Coupons: Approximately 41% of individuals accept Bar coupons. However, this rate escalates to 76% for those who go to bars more than three times a month. Furthermore, the acceptance rate surpasses 70% when the drivers are younger (below 30 years old), accompanied by friends or family, have a preference for budget-friendly dining, and earn less than $50K annually.

- Coffee Coupons: Nearly 50% of individuals accept coffee coupons, with men being slightly more receptive. Acceptance drops to 36% when drivers are headed home. Professionals in "Healthcare" and "Cleaning & Maintenance" show the highest acceptance at 74% and 72%, respectively. Students also have a high acceptance rate of 62%. Notably, drivers accompanied by peers show a higher propensity to accept these coupons than solo drivers or those with kids.
